	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<p>A little bit about my favorite ingredients to cook with and eat.</p>
	
	<h3>Cilantro</h3>
	<p>At first, cilantro was one of my most hated foods. It's generally known to have a "soapy" taste and I found that true in my first experiences with the herb. After trying it a few times in various recipes I began to acquire a taste for it and it eventually turned into my favorite ingredient.</p>
	<h4>When to use it:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>In salsa</li>
	<li>As a garnish</li>
	<li>In soups and sandwiches</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tomatoes</h3>
	<p>Tomatoes have a long history and tie into my Italian heritage. For many years my family used fresh tomatoes to make sauce for pastas and other Italian dishes. I grown to enjoy tomatoes that way and on basically everything I eat.</p>
	<h4>When to use them:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>When making tomato sauce</li>
	<li>On sandwiches</li>
	<li>In salsa</li>
	<li>In salads</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Chipotle Peppers</h3>
	<p>Most of my experience with Chipotles have been with canned or dried chipotle but the flavor it adds is great enough to work its way into my favorites if used correctly. It adds a smokey, spice to any dish.</p>
	<h4>When to use it:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>When boiling chicken and a few dried chipotles</li>
	<li>When making chili dice up a couple canned chipotles in adobo sauce</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Lime</h3>
	<p>Lime adds a refreshing spark of citrus flavor to everything all your favorite meals.</p>
	<h4>When to use it:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Best on cooked chicken or fish</li>	
	</ul>

	<h2>Places</h2>
	<p>I don't always feel like cooking, and when I don't, I go to these places.</p>
	
	<h3>Tio Luis</h3>
	<p>A Mexican restaurant on the south side of Chicago. A small but tidy place. Home to some of the best tacos in the city</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tio-luis-tacos-chicago">Check it out on Yelp.</a></p>
	
	<h3>Honky Tonk BBQ</h3>
	<p>Another small dive type restaurant in the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago with a western vibe. The pulled pork sandwiches are as messy as they are delicious. Be prepared to towel off after.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/honky-tonk-bbq-chicago">Check it out on Yelp.</a></p>

	
	<h3>Mastro's Steakhouse</h3>
	<p>Located across the street from Rock and Roll McDonalds downtown Chicago, if you're looking to class it up a little, look no further. The steaks are the best in Chicago and the Tuna Tar Tar makes an excellent starter. </p>
	<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mastros-steakhouse-chicago">Check it out on Yelp.</a></p>

	
	<h3>The Doughnut Vault</h3>
	<p>Tucked away in a little corner behind the Merchandise Mart, the tiny establishment cranks out the softest, tastiest most calorie packed doughnuts I've ever tasted. The line that wraps around the building each morning says enough about this place. The menu is small so make sure to try them all, at least 10 times.</p>
